sequence of integers and finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence. 
input:
 - ./lab11-lis 10 9 2 5 3 7 101 18

output: 4
 - **Explanation: possible LIS: 2, 3, 7, 101
 
Known:
 -  accepts a sequence of integers
    (positive or negative) as command-line arguments.
 - A subsequence is a sequence derived by deleting zero or more elements 
 without changing the relative order. 
 
 - An increasing subsequence is one where each element is 
    strictly greater than the previous.

Plan:
make an arr for all of them
I'll need to make a list for the first one.
